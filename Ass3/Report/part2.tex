\subsubsection{1}

Figure \ref{transactiontable} shows the transaction table after analysis phase:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{verbatim}
LSN    LAST_LSN    TRAN_ID    TYPE            PAGE_ID
---    --------    -------    ----            -------
1      -           -          begin CKPT      -
2      -           -          end CKPT        -
3      3           T1         update          P2
4      4           T1         update          P1
5      5           T2         update          P5
6      6           T2         update          P5
7      7           T2         update          P3
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{dirtypagetable} shows the dirty page table after analysis phase:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{verbatim}
PAGE_ID    recSLN
-------    ------
P2         3
P1         4
P5         5
P3         7
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Dirty page table after analysis phase.\label{dirtypagetable}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{2}
The set of winner transactions is ${T3}$ since it finished, and the loser transaction set is ${T1,T2}$ since they did not, and so they are in the transaction table to be recovered.

\subsubsection{3}
The redo phase starts at LSN 3, since we are repeating history since the checkpoint. The undo phase starts at 7, since all the updates need to be undone

\subsubsection{4}
The set of log records that may cause pages to be re-written during the redo phase is {3,4,5,6,7}, since these updates need to be repeated, and they all affect pages.

\subsubsection{5}
The set of log records undone during undo phase: {3,4,5,6,7}, since these are all in the $ToUndo$ set.

\subsubsection{6}
Figure \ref{transactiontableafterrecovery} shows the recovery procedure table after the recovery completes:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{verbatim}

2      -           -          end CKPT            -
3      3           T1         update              P2
